# Time-Zone-Chatbot

Chatbot is a computer program that simulates a natural human conversation. 
Users communicate with a chatbot via the chat interface or by voice, like how they would talk to a real person. 
This chatbot is developed using Python and Rasa.
When the user asks time zone, the bot will prompt for the location and it will display the time zone of the given location.
